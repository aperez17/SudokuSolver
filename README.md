# SudukoSolver

This repository is to be used for implementing and solving suduko puzzles. We will use Scala as our programming language.

If you do not already have Scala. http://www.scala-lang.org/download/
Also I would recomend using sbt http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html

From there run 'sbt eclipse' to create an eclipse project if you wish to then import it using the eclipse import wizard.

Other than that lets kill this!!!
