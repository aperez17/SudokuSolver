# SudokuSolver

##This repository is to be used for implementing and solving sudoku puzzles. We will use Scala as our programming language.

# Installation
If you do not already have Scala. http://www.scala-lang.org/download/
Also I would recomend using sbt http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html

From there run:
```
sbt eclipse
```
to create an eclipse project if you wish to then import it using the eclipse import wizard.

Try to create tests for just about everything you make, do not commit to master only to develop. Create your own branches then pull into develop when developing after a certain period we will push all our changes to master branch.

To run tests just run:
```
sbt test
```

To run the project just run:
```
sbt compile
sbt run
```

####Other than that lets kill this!!!
